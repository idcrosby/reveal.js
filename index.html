					<h2>Living the Continuous Delivery Dream</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						- Thanks to Implicit Explicit, Werker etc...
        				So before I start, who here currently is doing Continuous Integration at their company? What about Continuous Delivery (Okay, you can leave)? And is anyone doing Continuous Deployment? And for everyone else, who is working to implement Continuous Integration or Delivery at their company, or would like to? So this should be everyone?
        				
        				- Ok just want to make sure I'm speaking to the right crowd.
        				
        				- So I want to start with defining some terms.
    				</aside>

						<h3>Continuous ... </h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							The theme here is continuity
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Continuous Integration is defined as a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
						</aside>
						<aside class="notes">	
							- So many teams say we have Git, Unit Tests, and Jenkins. Great, we're doing CI. 

							- The tools themselves don't equal the process. They enable you to adopt CI, but there is more required. You need to follow and buy in to the paradigm.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Continuous Deployment</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							- Continuous Deployment is an additional layer built on top of CI, in which every change that goes through your pipeline, automated builds, tests, etc, then gets pushed straight into production automatically. 

							- So teams doing Continuous Deployment, such as Etsy, end of deploying to production 10, 15, or even more times a day.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Continuous Delivery</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							- So Continuous Delivery includes all the same requirements as Continuous Deployment, but the push to production step is left optional. We are able and confident to push each change in production, but we may not necessarily do so. The choice to release software is essentially a business decision.

							- The goal of CD is to build software in such a way that it can be released to production at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently.

							- The focus of this talk is Continuous Delivery.
							I won’t go into the benefits of CD in this talk, these have been well established and there are plenty of blogs/papers/talks dispelling the many positives of implementing Continuous Delivery. As we have seen from the questions earlier, we are at the point where It is generally accepted that continuous delivery is where we should be as a mature software development team. So the logical question is why are we not all doing this already? We agree it’s the way forward, and understand the benefits and savings we’ll gain, so let’s implement this!

					</section>
					<section data-transition="fade" data-markdown data-notes="Because it’s not trivial to implement. Setting up a pipeline, migrating existing infrastructure, adding new tooling, all of this takes serious investment. And it can be hard to take the time out and/or to convince the necessary people to do this. 

					So what I want to focus on is how we can use existing tools, such as Docker, Kubernetes, to help us get there.

					First, let's jump back a little bit... how did we get to where we are?">

					<h2>A long time ago, on a dev team far, far away...</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						- Back in ancient times we had this wonderful thing called waterfall, as developers we were blissful and ignorant, write some Fortran, compile it (or assemble or whatever the hell you do with Fortran) and I'm done! No longer my problem. I throw it over the proverbial wall and let the QA/Test/Ops guys deal with it. On to the next thing...

						- But inevitably someone would come knocking on our desk, "You broke the build", "The integration tests are failing",  "Why did you eat my lunch?". And what would our response be...

						<h2>"It works on my machine"</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							- I don’t know what kind of crazy windows server you’re trying to run this on, but my code works.

							- This was the old excuse, we’re better than that now right?

						<h1>Agile</h1>

							We’ve gone through agile and scrum eras and ...
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>Dev Ops!</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							- We’re living in the dev ops period, which pretty much means that when we toss the code over the wall, we’ve gotta run over there to catch it ourselves. So we understand that their are other dependencies, and pieces involved in the process. My application needs to interact with a database, with a front end, etc
							- But let's go back for a minute
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>It works on my machine</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Why is this not valid statement? if it works on my machine, why shouldn't it work in production? We're not bad developers. We write sensible code, usually, so if my application is running on my local environment and I'm happy with it, it should be reasonable to assume it can run in prod with confidence. So how do we get this confidence? 
						</aside>

						<h3>Development == Production<span class="fragment"> ...ish</span></h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							- We need our development environments to be identical to our produciton environments... or at least close.

							- I need to be running the same software on dev as I do on production. Not just the right version/branch/tag but using the same dependencies. So Docker helps to solve this problem for us, we build a Docker image which use for development testing, and we use the same image on testing/staging/production.  Docker in itself cannot solve this for us, but it helps. And that is the focus here, is that we now have tooling which makes Continuous Delivery easier to achieve.

							- I need to run my software on the same OS, of the same version, with the same libraries, etc. Again, Docker helps us to sovle this, the image we build contains not just our code, but the OS as well.

							- What about external dependencies. So databases, how do we ensure we are developing against the same database as we will run in production?  As we move into a micro services architecture, there are more and more dependencies which our service, our application we are developing needs to interact with and depend on. So here we are moving into territory where Docker itself isn't quite enough for us, even if we containerize all of our micro services, how do we control them?

					<h2>Orchestrate ALL the things!</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						As we increase the number of dependancies and the number of containers we need some sort of orchestration tool to maintain consistency within and across our environments. There are many of these tools available, such as Deis, I will take a look at Kubernetes as well as Red Hat’s OpenShift platform which is built on top of k8s.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Kubernetes</h3>
					<img src="img/kubernetes.png" style="border-style: none">
					<aside class="notes">
						I assume most people are already familiar with Kubernetes? For those who aren't, it's basically an orchestration platform for Containers. It allows for automated deployment, scaling of our application
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>OpenShift</h3>
					<img src="img/openshift.png" style="border-style: none">
					<aside class="notes">
						- If you were at the Docker meetup back in November, Alessandro gave an introduction to OpenShift. For those not familiar with OpenShift, it is Red Hat's PaaS built on top of Kubernetes.

						- OpenShift supports different setups, it is possible to run a completely separate cluster for each environment (e.g. dev, staging, production) or use a single cluster for several environments. If you run a separate OpenShift PaaS for each environment, they will each have their own dedicated and isolated resources. However, multiple environments can safely run on one OpenShift cluster through the platform’s support for resource isolation, which allows nodes to be dedicated to specific environments. This means you will have one OpenShift cluster with common masters for all environments, but dedicated nodes assigned to specific environments. This allows for scenarios such as only allowing production projects to run on the more powerful / expensive nodes.
